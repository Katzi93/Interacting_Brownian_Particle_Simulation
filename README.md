# Interacting_Brownian_Particle_Simulation

The code runs on Matlab 2020b and probably also on newer versions.
The main file in each folder is "sp_sim_vectorized.m" and "sp_sim_vectorized_radomsize". That is the file you want to execute in Matlab.
The file "circle.m" is for plotting circles.
"Dipolhertzquadrandsize.m" and "Dipolhertzquad5.m" compute the particle interactions.

The code produces huge output files if you choosen a very large simulations.  

Please cite my publication "Emergence of colloidal patterns in AC electrical fields" if you use my code for your own publication.
